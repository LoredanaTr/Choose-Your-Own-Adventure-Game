Adventure Game with Princes and Princesses

In this interactive game, children can explore a magical kingdom by making choices along the way. The game uses if, elif, and else statements to guide the story based on the player's decisions. These are conditional statements that allow the story to branch out into different paths, leading to various exciting outcomes like finding treasure, talking to a unicorn, or attending a royal ball!

    if statement: This checks a condition. If it's true, the game will proceed with the corresponding block of code.
    elif statement: Short for "else if," this is used after an if statement to check another condition if the first one wasn't true.
    else statement: This catches any situation where neither the if nor the elif conditions were met, providing a default outcome.

The player is prompted to type their choices, and based on those inputs, the story unfolds, creating a fun and interactive experience.
